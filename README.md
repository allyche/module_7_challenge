# Create a Web Application for an ETF Analyzer

In this Challenge assignment, I built a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF. Key tasks were:

1. Analyze a single asset in the FinTeh ETF
2. Optimize the SQL queries to filter data
3. Analyze the FinTech ETG portfolio

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

1. [pandas] (https://pandas.pydata.org/) a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. 
2. [numpy] NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data.
3. [PyViz] PyViz is a Python visualization package that provides a single platform for accessing multiple visualization libraries. Two of these libraries are Plotly Express and hvPlot.
4. [sqlalchemy] SQLAlchemy is an open-source SQL library for Python. It’s designed to ease the communication between Python-based programs and databases.
4. [voila] With Voilà, a Python library, you can convert a Jupyter notebook into a live webpage. 

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
import sqlalchemy
